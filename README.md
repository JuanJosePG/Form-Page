# Form

I created this page to practice in my way to be a Front End Developer. This is a form page clean and simple. The main idea was to create it as responsive as possible.

As we can see, the web page is imitating an shipment form with a theme similar to Google.

There is a link to see in action: [CodePen - Form Page + Bootstrap](https://codepen.io/jjpg/full/QWERmBY)

## Bootstrap

To carry out the responsive behavior, I used the framework Bootstrap, which is a mobile-first framework, with the version 4.5.3.



### Installation

We can use the CDN (Content Delivery Network) with requirement that we need an Internet connection.

An another way, is to download the package.

```bash
#Via npm
npm install bootstrap

#Via gem
gem install bootstrap -v 4.5.3
```
